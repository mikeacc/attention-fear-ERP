# Attentional bias in anxiety: a behavioral and ERP study
(Bar-Haim et al, 2005)

Attention for different em. expr. in high- and low- anxiety individuals.
- attention shifting paradigm: fixate face cue; discriminate shape displayed adjacently. 
- high anxious participants were slower to respond, regardless of expression. 
- ERP indicate that threat-related faces elicited faster latencies and greater ampliturdes of early ER{ components in HA subj's.
Results:
	- main effect of emotion on P1 amplitude
	- group x electrode(Pz, Oz) interaction on P1 latency (faster for HA)
	- m. e. of emotion on N1 amplitude (greater for fearful expr.)
	- electrode(Oz) x group inter. on N1 latency (faster for HA subj.)
Slower RTs for HA participants regardless of expression.
Hence, slower RTs for HA group could be driven by enhanced processing of the cue. 

# Neural correlates of attention biases, behavioral inhibition and social anxiety in children: An ERP study
(Thai et al, 2016)

Behavioural inhibition (BI):
	- among the strongest risk factors for *social anxiety disorder*.
Is this link affected by attention?
	- dot-probe task with neutral vs neutral facial stimuli
	
	- P2: linked to decreased anxiety. Moderates link btwn  BI-Social Anxiety
	- N2: x BI interaction. Increasing attention to compensate for effects of social anxiety (threat avoidance or 'over-controlled socio-emotional functioning').
	- children w/o B showed higher P1 to probes replacing angry faces, hinting at ease of attentional resources maintanance in threat-related contexts.

  
# Attentional bias to angry faces using the dot-probe task? It depends when you look for it 
- from 100 ms: attention towards threatening stimulus. 
- at 500ms: reversed bias. 
- hence: for longer delays and HA subjs, selective attention leading towards threatening stimulus might be driven by inhibition of its counterpart, rather than facilitation itself.

# Developmental Relations Among Behavioral Inhibition, Anxiety, and Attention Biases to Threat and Positive Information
(White et al, 2017)

BI: heightened negative reactivity and vigialnce toward novel and unfamiliar people and situations (Fox et al, 2001). Also one of the strongest developmental predictors of anxiety disorders in later childhood an adolescence (Chronis-Tuscano et al., 2009). 
AB: Anxious ind. tend to allocate their attention to potential sources of threat (Bra-Haim et al., 2007). 

Experiment: 
	- BI assessed by composite score and parent report at age 2 and 3. 
	- AB by dot-probe with angry, happy and neutral expressions. 
	- Anxiety: Chiled Behavior Checklist at age 5 and 7

Results (images)
ABP at age 7 was found to moderate link between BI and anxiety (high BI children with low ABP display greater anxiety).

# ERP and ANT

P1 (cue locked):
	- higher amp. for double/spatial cue as opposed to center cue. 
	- higher amp. for no cue than for double cue (alerting effect)
	- same when target locked
pN1 (cue locked):
	- higher amp. for double/spatial cues vs centre cue.
	- higher for no cue cond. than for double and spatial cues. 
N1 (cue locked):
	- Occ. and par. regions: larger amp. for double cue vs center/spatial cues
	- t-locked N1 was larger for spatial/double vs central/no cue.
pP1:
	- larger mean for the double condition vs center/spatial cue. (orienting)
	- t-locked: smaller amp. for no cue cond.
pN:
	- higher amp. for spatial cue vs all others. 
P3:
	- par. and occ. areas display larger amp. for congruent and neutral vs incongurent targets
